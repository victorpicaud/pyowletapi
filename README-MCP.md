## Data Privacy

This MCP server:
- ‚úÖ Connects directly to Owlet's official API
- ‚úÖ Does not store or transmit your data to third parties
- ‚úÖ Uses your existing Owlet account permissions
- ‚úÖ Logs only to local stderr for debugging

## Troubleshooting

### Authentication Issues

1. **Invalid Credentials Error**:
   - Verify your email and password in the `.env` file
   - Ensure you can log into the Owlet app with the same credentials

2. **Region Error**:
   - Set `OWLET_REGION=europe` if you have a European Owlet account
   - Use `OWLET_REGION=world` for US/Canada/other regions

### Connection Issues

1. **No Devices Found**:
   - Ensure your devices are set up in the Owlet app
   - Check that devices are online and connected

2. **API Timeout**:
   - Check your internet connection
   - Ensure Owlet services are operational

### Claude Desktop Integration

1. **Server Not Showing Up**:
   - Restart Claude for Desktop completely
   - Check the JSON syntax in `claude_desktop_config.json`
   - Verify the absolute path to `mcp_server.py`

2. **Tool Calls Failing**:
   - Check Claude's logs: `~/Library/Logs/Claude/` (macOS) or `%APPDATA%\Claude\Logs\` (Windows)
   - Verify environment variables are correctly set

## Development

### Running the Server Manually

```bash
python mcp_server.py
```

### Testing Tools

You can test individual tools by running the server and sending JSON-RPC requests, or by using it through Claude Desktop.
